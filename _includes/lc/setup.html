  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p>
   We will use a Jupyter Hub environment for the workshop, so you'll be able to run Python directly from the browser on your laptop without installing anything. 
    If you would like to install Python and Jupyter on your laptop, however, you can follow <a href="https://chennesy.github.io/lc-python-intro/#installing-python-using-anaconda">these instructions</a>.
